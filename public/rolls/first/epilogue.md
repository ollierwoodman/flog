### Final thoughts

The feeling of receiving the photos back and opening them up for the first time was such a rush!

I'm so ecstatic with how they came out. There's a handful of shots that I really really like!

After discovering the issue with my camera's focus I have now purchased a new camera (Olymupus Pen f3.5) and for now all future film magazines will be shot on that. My camera is fully manually operated and hence I'm sure there will be a lot more mistakes and a lot more learning in the future.
