This is my first time working with film photography.

My goal with film photography are to capture moments and places in their rawest form, without the contamination of software tricks, AI enhancement or anything of the like.

Just like when learning anything new, not every shot I have taken here is perfect. However, by presenting them as a (mostly) complete roll of film, I want to present these mistakes in their original form and document the struggles I face. That being said, the camera I used has a broken auto-focus mechanism and was only able to focus to its nearest focal range.
