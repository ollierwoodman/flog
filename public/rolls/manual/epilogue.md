# Learnings

Shooting manual is hard. It requires more of your attention and becomes more of a process; Getting your phone out to meter the light, finding a good balance of apeture and shutter speed, setting the camera and taking the shot. But despite the degree of difficulty, it is incredibly rewarding. The freedom of expression is a lot higher and there is so much to learn.

It's clear that I need to focus (haha) on improving exposure levels and focusing ranges. When light-metering, I consistently rounded-up when caught in between stops that my Olympus Pen couldn't replicate which did lead to some pretty over-exposed shots. I was under the impression that it is better to over than under expose with film, but I think I will dial that back a bit and try to get as close as possible to a 50/50 grey as possible.

I am becoming more and more comfortable with the Pen every time I use it. I love it for its compact size and fully mechanical feature set. It feels so sturdy and all of the manual controls are solid and tactile. I'm also really impressed at how sharp the lens can be (when properly focused haha).
